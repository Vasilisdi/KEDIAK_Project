# RISKAC Research Program - Environmental Data Collection Project

## Overview

This project, associated with the RISKAC research program, aims to collect environmental data using an electronics system comprising various components. The system is designed to measure temperature, VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds), and other environmental parameters. It utilizes a custom-designed PCB fabricated with KiCAD to provide users with a convenient "plug and play" option. Additionally, the project involves adapting source code for different sensors to meet specific project requirements.

## Tools Used

- SQL
- Python
- Arduino Programming Language
- KiCAD
- Fritzing
- PHP
- 3D Printing

## Components and Features

- **Electronic Components**: The system incorporates a variety of sensors for temperature, VOC, and other environmental data collection.
- **Custom PCB**: Designed with KiCAD, the PCB facilitates easy integration of sensors and ensures efficient communication and power supply.
- **Data Storage and Management**: Data collected by the sensors is stored in CSV files using Spyder platform. The last instance of stored data is then stored in a database for further analysis and retrieval.
- **3D-Printed Case**: A protective case with humidity-removing extruded features has been 3D-printed to safeguard electronic components and ensure reliable operation in varying environmental conditions.

## Project Progression

The project began with a power breadboard prototype and evolved into the development of a sophisticated PCB that meets the communication and power supply needs of the integrated sensors.
